This repository contains an addon **Leg Kick** for **ArmA 3** game. You can feel free to use, modify and reupload this mod, it created just for fun.

This addon allows you to kick enemies with your leg. Show them true force of Nvidia PhysX. Default hotkey for action: **Y**, you can change it in control settings.

# Multiplayer:
You can expect strange physics simulation in multiplayer because of ArmA engine. So, if you really want it, you need to whitelist a `Dr_fnc_legKick` function into cfgRemoteExec in your mission.

# Known Issues:
- Enemies can die while flying in ragdoll, especially, when they throwed onto another object.
